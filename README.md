# SpringCW wiki!

## 1. SpringBoot development task
Create a SpringBoot application guided by the following three iteration plan descriptors;
### Iteration1: (30 marks)
1. A SpringBoot application consisting of model, controller and a view – at least one of each
2. Build should be done using Maven
3. The view should contain at least one data entry element which allows users to enter values
   for minimum of two different fields, one of which should be a float type.
   The float type value should be subjected to a processing stage and used to produce at least
   two useful outputs (i.e. calculating a mean, maximum, sum, standard deviation etc).
   Outcome of this should be presented back to the user – in a useful manner based on the
   scenario you have chosen.

Note: You have the freedom to select a suitable scenario that involves the above a-d
elements. e.g. calculating the average, minimum and maximum salary of group of
employees, based on the empNum, name, salary values entered into the application.
### Iteration2; (15 marks)
1. Add a persistence layer to your application. Users should be now able to view the
outcome described in Iteration1-c, and also be able to see all the values entered in to
the application; i.e. list of all employees’ details, their salary values, and then the
descriptive statistics such as mean, maximum etc. You are expected to use an inmemory
database for this task.
Note; You may refer to the POM extract supplied in Appendix A, to identify useful
dependencies for your application.
2. Introduce a suitable View to present your output to users
### Iteration3; (15 marks)
1. Introduce Update and Delete features to your application. i.e. You should be now having
a complete CRUD application to demonstrate.
CI6110 Programming III – Java Spring
Dr. Pushpa Kumarapeli. Kingston university - London
Requirement: You need to complete at least one of the above iterations in pair-programming
mode. You are free to select your pair programing partner, however this has to be clearly
indicated in your individual report (details given below)
### Report (30 marks)
Based on the tasks you have completed above, create a report covering the following structure;
a. Introduction to Java Spring and SpringBoot (minimum 1 page)
b. Description of the completed iterations; include the screen captures of the project
structure and any Views, final POM file content (as text or screen capture), discussions
around any challenges or noteworthy achievements (no page limit, minimum 500 words
for discussion)
c. Discussion on the pair programming element; Name and K number of other
programmer, Iteration details, amount of work – in man hours, final outcome with
reference to noteworthy interactions and a reflective account on the experience (
minimum 200 words)
Requirement: Upload the final package and the individual report via the links provided within
Canvas.
3. Demonstration/viva (10 marks)
A 10 minute demonstration of your application
Level of work expected:
This is a major piece of work and it is expected that you will need to do some very thorough research
and that ideally your research will be as up to date as possible given that this is a very rapidly moving
field. Work containing vague descriptions or unsupported assertions will be penalised.
